        "description": "Explosives of the sort depicted here are normally restricted to members of the Scorpion shinobi organizations (the Infiltrators, Actors, and Saboteurs) and the Daidoji Harriers, and only in games set subsequent to the White Stag Era. After White Stag but prior to the War Against the Darkness, the covert connection between the Shosuro family and the Lying Darkness means that Goju and Ninube Shadowspawn can also have access to explosives.\n (It is up to the GM whether the Goju and Ninube can still gain access to this material after the defeat of the Lying Darkness. It is possible the Shadow Dragon might be able to steal the knowledge of manufacturing gaijin pepper in order to let his minions continue to use explosives.) In game terms, explosives take two basic forms: nageteppo (egg grenades) and demolition charges. Nageteppo are widely and readily used by ninja of all sorts and the GM should not hesitate to allow “ninja” PCs to make or use them. Demolition charges, however, are used much more sparingly, since their effects are far more blatant and the connection to forbidden gunpowder is quite obvious.\n The GM should consider carefully whether to allow PCs to gain access to them.\n Standard smoke nageteppo are used to confuse enemies during an ambush or to cover a retreat. They are small and relatively fragile egg-shaped devices containing a mixture of gunpowder and alchemical substances.\n Throwing a nageteppo is a Simple Action. When they are broken (either by accident, crushing, or most commonly by being thrown against a hard surface) the contents ignite and emit a thick cloud of choking white smoke. The smoke covers an area roughly 15’ diameter and obscures all vision within (those inside the smoke are considered to be Blind). The smoke normally lasts five Rounds before it disperses, although it can be blown away in a single Round by a strong wind.\n If a smoke nageteppo directly strikes a person, the burning smoke charge inflicts 1k1 damage per Round for two Rounds (or until extinguished with dousing, smothering, etc)."

When an incendiary nageteppo is broken the contents ignite violently and spray outward, igniting everything within 5’. Someone who is directly hit by an incendiary nageteppo will take 3k2 damage per Round for three Rounds (or until the fire is doused/smothered).

More rarely, they may be used as mines, placing them on a battlefield and igniting them when enemy troops march over the position.\n (This latter usage is extremely risky, since if any of the enemy troops escape alive they will be able to report the use of forbidden gunpowder on the battlefield.) Once a demolition charge is set, it must be detonated.\n This is normally done by introducing flame to the charge— such as by firing a flaming arrow at it, or leaving a burning piece of rope or cloth which will reach the charge after a certain amount of time. Clever shinobi have also devised ways to detonate demolition charges by means of physical mechanisms and incendiaries (such as placing a nageteppo which will crack at the right moment). After the Agasha invent hanabi (fireworks), Rokugani ninja use hanabi fuses to ignore demolition charges, a much more reliable method Damage from demolition charges is gunpowder damage which means it ignores Reduction on living targets. It  also ignores 20 points of Reduction on inanimate targets (buildings, castles, etc).

This allows a stone to be hurled much farther than by hand alone. Although most samurai would never consider using such a crude weapon, monks and ashigaru have no such qualms, and ronin, Sparrow samurai, and Unicorn samurai have all been known to use the weapon from time to time. Members of the Sparrow Clan consider the sling to be an acceptable weapon despite its peasant origins, and should not lose Honor when using a sling.
